### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as an Apple Platforms Developer for Ryanair while I try to find time for building open-source apps to publish on the App Store.
- 🌱 I’m also learning more and more about SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency and related frameworks.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creating engaging apps using the very latest tech.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help researching lesser known aspects of the Apple frameworks as I tend to fall deep into all sorts of 🐇🕳s.
- 💬 Ask me about Swift and I'm sure to respond. Other topics I'm familiar with are Web Standards and UNIX/Linux.
- 📫 How to reach me: find me on Twitter under @diegolavalledev. Also checkout [my site](https://diegolavalle.com).
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started programming at a very young age using a PowerPC-based Mac! 🤓
